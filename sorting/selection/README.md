# Selection Sort
## How it works
Simply at each step it is found out where the **smallest** number in the array is located. By replacing this number with the number at the beginning of the series, the smallest numbers are selected and thrown to the beginning.

## Algorithm
- It can be implemented as a stable sort
- Method Selection

## Complexity 
The complexity of this algorithm is O(n2), because n numbers are processed at each step, and this process is repeated n times.

|Type|Big(O)
|:-|:-
|Worst   | O(n2)
|Average | O(n2)
|Memory  | O(1)
